# **PyBer_Analysis**

### **Purpose**
Here is a quick overview for the main highlights of the Pyber Analysis made during the first months of 2019.
The goal of the analysis is to understand the existing differences among the trends and fares for each city type among the Pyber services coverage.
#

## **Results**
Based on the latest figures, 68% of the total rides during the analyzed period are located in urban-type cities; however that accounts for slightly less than 63% of the total income, which means there is an profit opportunity among the less dynamic city types.

As seen on the following summary chart, both average fare per ride (AFPR) and average fare per driver (AFPR) are +40% and +200% higher in Rural cities.

The gap is well explained by the Supply and Demand law given the current volume of both dirvers and rides in these rural and suburban cities. Nontheless, we believe there could be a growth potential in these areas which would result in an important revenue increase as the prices stabilize with the urban cities averages.

This is why we also analyzed the fare trends by each of the analyzed city-types:

As shown on the above line plot, the overall weekly fare for the urban cities has become flat during the past couple months, however we can observe an slightly increasing trend in rural-cities as well as an importan peak for suburban fares.

Based on all of the above, our recommendation is to develop some campaigns to further promote the ussage and coverage of PyBer between rural and suburban cities.

## **Recommentations:**

1. Improve driver coverage in rural-like cities to adress the increasing demand for rides in these areas (i.e more aggresive driver compensation).
2. Further analyze the Suburban behavior to better understand the erratic fare trends.
3. Take advantage of current urban concentration by developing different ride-related services to improve average revenue per user and driver (i.e. delivery services).
